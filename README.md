## Disclaimers / important information

 * This is a fork from the official [Grafana setup for YUNoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/grafana_ynh)
 * This Grafana setup ships standalone, without any datasource pre-installed. You'll have to setup one, for instance Prometheus, InfluxDB or Netdata.

## Configuration

### Using With Prometheus

 * [Install Prometheus with YUNoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/prometheus_ynh)
 * Install the node-exporter package `sudo apt install prometheus-node-exporter`
 * Configure Prometheus to Scrap the node exporter, by adding the following snippet under the prometheus config, then restart prometheus.

```yaml
# /opt/yunohost/prometheus/prometheus.yml
# ...
scrape_configs:
  # Keep the prometheus job...
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```
 * Add Prometheus as a datasource on Grafana. Be careful that if you have added `Prometheus` on a non root path of a domain, you'll need to use this path the datasource URL too. For instance the datasource prometheus address is `http://localhost:9100/prometheus` because Prometheus is installed under `myserver.com/prometheus`. 
 * You can now install an dashboard to view exported metrics, we recommend the excellent [Node Exporter Full](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/1860-node-exporter-full) dashboard.
 * You can also define alerts on Grafana.
